# Bug Fixes and Improvements

## Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. Image Upload System Implementation
**Problem:** Images weren't being uploaded or stored properly
**Solution:**
- Integrated Supabase Storage for image uploads
- Created `property-images` bucket with proper RLS policies
- Implemented file upload logic in PropertyContext
- Generate unique filenames to prevent conflicts
- Store public URLs in MySQL database

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/lib/supabase.js` (created)
- `frontend/src/context/PropertyContext.jsx`
- `supabase/migrations/create_property_images_bucket.sql` (created)

### 2. Image Array Handling in Backend
**Problem:** Backend wasn't handling empty image arrays correctly
**Solution:**
- Added null/empty checks before mapping images
- Return empty array if no images found
- Prevents crashes when properties have no images

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/controllers/propertyController.js` (getAllProperties)
- `backend/controllers/propertyController.js` (getPropertyById)

### 3. PropertyContext Image Field Mismatch
**Problem:** loadUserProperties using wrong field `p.primary_image` instead of `p.images`
**Solution:**
- Changed to use `p.images || []` to match backend response
- Consistent with other property loading functions

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/context/PropertyContext.jsx` (loadUserProperties)

### 4. Environment Variables Not Used
**Problem:** Hardcoded database and JWT credentials
**Solution:**
- Created `.env` file in backend
- Updated all files to use `process.env` variables
- Loaded dotenv in all necessary files
- Improved security and configurability

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/.env` (created)
- `backend/config/database.js`
- `backend/controllers/authController.js`
- `backend/middleware/auth.js`
- `backend/server.js`

### 5. Missing Supabase Storage Bucket
**Problem:** No storage bucket configured for property images
**Solution:**
- Created migration to set up storage bucket
- Configured public read access
- Set up RLS policies for upload/delete
- File size limit: 5MB
- Allowed types: JPG, PNG, WebP

**Files Created:**
- `supabase/migrations/20251031143333_add_images_column_to_properties.sql`

## Improvements Made

### 1. Comprehensive README
- Added detailed setup instructions
- Documented all API endpoints
- Included troubleshooting section
- Listed all bug fixes
- Added tech stack details

### 2. Error Handling
- Better null checks in image handling
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- Improved error messages

### 3. Code Consistency
- Consistent use of environment variables
- Standard error response format
- Proper async/await patterns

## Architecture

### Image Storage Flow
1. User selects images in Add Property page
2. Frontend uploads to Supabase Storage
3. Supabase returns public URLs
4. URLs sent to backend API
5. Backend stores URLs in MySQL `property_images` table
6. Frontend fetches and displays images

### Database Structure
- **MySQL (Backend):** Stores all data except images
  - Users, properties, schedules, favorites
  - Property image URLs (not the actual files)

- **Supabase Storage:** Stores actual image files
  - Public bucket: `property-images`
  - User-organized: `{user_id}/{filename}`

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Frontend builds without errors
- [x] Backend dependencies installed
- [x] Environment variables configured
- [x] Database migrations applied
- [x] Storage bucket created
- [x] Image upload logic implemented
- [x] Null/empty checks in place
- [x] README documentation complete

## Next Steps for User

1. Start XAMPP/WAMP MySQL server
2. Import `database_setup.sql` in PHPMyAdmin
3. Verify Supabase credentials in frontend `.env`
4. Run backend: `cd backend && npm start`
5. Run frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
6. Login with admin credentials
7. Test image upload by creating a property

## Known Limitations

1. Chunk size warning in build (not critical)
   - Bundle is ~556KB
   - Can be optimized with code splitting later

2. No image compression before upload
   - Images uploaded as-is
   - 5MB limit enforced

3. No progress indicator for uploads
   - Upload happens but no visual feedback
   - Can be added later

## Security Notes

- JWT secrets should be changed in production
- Database password should be set
- Supabase RLS policies in place
- CORS properly configured
- File type validation on upload
